/**
 * A Sequence Flow is used to show the order of Flow Elements in a Process or a Choreography. Each
 * Sequence Flow has only one source and only one target. The source and target MUST be from the set
 * of the following FlowElements: Events (Start, Intermediate, and End), Activities (Task and
 * Sub-Process; for Processes), Choreography Activities (Choreography Task and Sub-Choreography; for
 * Choreographies), and Gateways.
 * <p>
 * A Sequence Flow can optionally define a condition Expression, indicating that the token will be
 * passed down the Sequence Flow only if the Expression evaluates to true. This Expression is
 * typically used when the source of the Sequence Flow is a Gateway or an Activity.
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a conditional Sequence Flow is used from a source Activity, then there MUST be at least
 * one other outgoing Sequence Flow from that Activity.
 * <li>A source Gateway MUST NOT be of type Parallel or Event.
 * </ul>
 * A Sequence Flow that has an Exclusive, Inclusive, or Complex Gateway or an Activity as its source
 * can also be defined with as default. Such a Sequence Flow will have a marker to show that it is a
 * default flow. The default Sequence Flow is taken (a token is passed) only if all the other
 * outgoing Sequence Flows from the Activity or Gateway are not valid (i.e., their condition
 * Expressions are false).
